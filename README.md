# UD-investigate_soccer_dataset
This repository contains my first python project submitted as part of Udacity's (UD) Data Analyst Nanodegree program

July 22, 2019 note: this was the first big major data project I conducted in Oct-Nov 2018 and as such a lot of the code can be optimized and cleaned up because I have a learned a lot since then.

Included files:
1. soccer_data_investigation.html      ==> this is an HTML file consisting of the project and it's results
2. soccer_data_investigation.ipynb     ==> this is the original source code of the project
3. Project_2_Nov_14_Henry.zip          ==> this is the zip file which contains all the csv files that were obtained using 'DB Browser for SQLite'. Future revisions here on github will incorporate the SQL code directly in python using an appropriate library.

How to use:

If you are interested in viewing the project you may simply open the HTML file in your browser.
If you are interested in tinkering around with the code you may use the ipython notebook, the required files are all found in the zip folder.


License: You may use any part of my work/code unless you are a fellow Udacity student enrolled in the Data Analyst Nanodegree program. In that case please reach out to me if you need any help completing your project :)

Expected revisions:  These changes are expected in the near future:

-importing a SQL library directly in my code to reduce the number of csv files
-Updating and shortening the algorithm from [1] to [12]. At the time of starting this project I was relatively new and inexperienced with these libraries.
-Updating the analysis towards the end of the project. I hadn't learned regression and multiple regression at the time of completing the project.
